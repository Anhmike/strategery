Description: System for testing strategies. The goal is to combine simple
    abstraction high-level syntax similar to Amibroker's AFL language
    (www.amibroker.com), flexibility of R - for example, Amibroker/Tradestation
    are constrained to technical analysis and can't work flexibly with
    fundamental data (quant value screen historical backtests) speed of
    data.table - which is implemented in C++, has faster sorting algos vs xts
    and uses database concepts.
